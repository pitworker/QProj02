TO RUN:
First, add a working NYT API key in the indicated location in the file 
final/config.js. The script will not run properly without this step.
Run a localhost and open final/index.html on your browser through the 
localhost.
Due to volume constraints on the NYT API, the page may take multiple minutes
to fetch all the NYT API information necessary for the project.  

FILE STRUCTURE:
final contains all the files necessary to run the final iteration of the
project, including all scripts and necessary typefaces. 
exploration contains scripts we used to develop various aspects of the 
project. 

NOTES:
The typeface being used is a trial version of Fleya. Because of this, some
symbols might not display properly on the webpage.
